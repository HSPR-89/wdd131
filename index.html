            <div>
                <p>I’m a 35-year-old electrical engineer living in Costa Rica, where I work as a manufacturing engineer
                    at Heraeus Medevio.
                    I’ve been happily married for 5 years and am a proud father of two wonderful daughters, Marielle and
                    Marianne, with whom
                    I love spending time and playing. Outside of work and family life, I’m a huge fan of
                    football—whether it’s playing or
                    watching, it’s a passion of mine. I feel fortunate to have a balanced life that brings together my
                    career, family, and
                    hobbies in a beautiful place like Costa Rica.</p>

                <p>Costa Rica is a small yet incredibly diverse country in Central America, known for its stunning
                    natural beauty, rich
                    biodiversity, and commitment to environmental sustainability. It is bordered by Nicaragua to the
                    north, Panama to the
                    south, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Caribbean Sea to the east. With a landscape that
                    ranges from lush
                    rainforests and volcanic mountains to pristine beaches, Costa Rica offers a unique blend of
                    ecosystems that make it a
                    haven for nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts. The country is renowned for its "pura vida"
                    lifestyle, which reflects
                    a relaxed, positive attitude toward life, and its stable democratic government, which has been in
                    place for over a
                    century. Costa Rica has no standing army, prioritizing instead investment in education and
                    healthcare, and is often
                    recognized as one of the happiest countries in the world. Its economy is largely driven by tourism,
                    agriculture, and
                    technology, and the country is also a leader in renewable energy, generating a significant portion
                    of its power from
                    hydroelectric, wind, and solar sources. Costa Ricans are known for their friendly, welcoming nature,
                    and the country’s
                    blend of modernity with a deep respect for tradition and nature makes it a truly unique and
                    enriching place to live and
                    visit.</p>
